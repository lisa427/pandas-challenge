This Jupyter notebook analyzes data from a gaming company that lists the in-game purchases for one of their games.  It is designed to work with a CSV file that contains: Purchase ID, Screen Name, Age, Gender, Item ID, Item Name, and Price.  

Some trends that can be seen from the data after being analyzed:

•	More males play the game (84% of the players are male), but females buy more expensive items on average and spend more per person than males.  The company might want to consider how to attract more females to playing the game. 
•	The age group 20-24 has the most players, but the age group 35-39 buys more expensive items on average and spends more per person.  The company might want to consider how to attract more players in the age group 35-39.
•	Three items (Final Critic, Oathbreaker, and Fiery Glass Crusader) are in both the top 5 most popular items and top 5 most profitable items lists.  The company might want to further analyze these items to see if they can boost the popularity of some of their other profitable items.
